# Super-Mario-Exhibit
An interactive interface prototype that features the history of Nintendo’s Super Mario video game series in the form of a touchscreen/iPad application.

## Project Description
Rather than overwhelming users with the lengthy information akin to an instruction manual, this exhibit focuses in on the unique elements and mechanics that each game brought to the series. This includes new powerups, character introductions, gimmicks (motion control, for instance), and any other unique facts that may be related to the creation or influence of certain installments. 

The opening timeline divides the games based on years and by genre (2D platforming versus 3D platforming). Upon entering a game’s page, the user will be able to scroll through a few pages of historical information, view box art, and watch gameplay videos. In the history section, there is a play button in the top right corner. This icon, when clicked, will lead the user to a video version of the history explained in writing on the default history page.

These summary videos were created and edited by me. I also added customized thumbnails for each video. In terms of graphics, I created the icons for each game on the main timeline page and used an online font generator to add in customized “Super Mario” font to the opening title screen. In addition, I edited a number of images in order to give them transparent backgrounds, especially for the new characters and Mario powerup/costume images. Lastly, I edited down clips of certain videos so that they would apply better to the user’s intended learning purpose. These edited clips include the “Super Mario Sunshine – Voice Acting Clip” and the “Super Mario Galaxy – Walking Around Planets Clip.” All custom edited clips and video summaries are uploaded to YouTube under the YouTube profile account: “Danny Nsouli.”
